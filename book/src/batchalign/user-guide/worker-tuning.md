# File Concurrency

**Status:** Current CLI guidance; historical worker-pool notes below

## The `--parallel` flag

`--parallel N` sets the maximum number of input files processed concurrently.
The default is 8 and the minimum is 1. Place this global option before the
command name:

```bash
batchalign3 --parallel 1 transcribe corpus/ -o output/
batchalign3 --parallel 4 morphotag corpus/ -o output/
```

This option was previously named `--workers`. Update scripts to use
`--parallel`.

For morphotag, active files feed a shared Stanza batcher. The backend executes
one model call at a time, with up to 128 utterances per batch. Each active file
can submit up to 128 pending utterances. File concurrency, utterance batch size,
and PyTorch's internal CPU threads are separate controls.

Increasing file concurrency can help keep batches full and overlap pipeline
stages. It also keeps more parsed transcripts and pending work resident in
memory. It does not create a Stanza model replica for each file.

The Python pipeline API continues to accept `workers=N` for file concurrency.

## Historical worker-pool notes

The remaining sections describe an earlier worker-pool architecture. They do
not describe the current local CLI's file-concurrency configuration.

## How worker planning works

When you submit a job, the server decides how many parallel file workers to
assign.

1. Compute a requested worker count from file count, CPU, and category caps:
   - GPU commands: `min(max_gpu_workers, gpu_thread_pool_size)`
   - CPU/IO commands: `max_thread_workers`
2. Ask the host-memory coordinator for a job execution plan.
3. The coordinator subtracts active local reservations, preserves
   `memory_gate_mb` as host headroom, and grants the largest safe worker count.
4. If nothing safe fits, the job is re-queued instead of speculatively running.

For a single file, the server always uses 1 worker — no parallelism needed.

If `max_workers_per_job` is set in `server.yaml`, it overrides auto-tuning
(still capped by file count and the category max).

**Why GPU commands allow parallelism:** GPU-heavy commands share a single
`SharedGpuWorker` process with a thread pool. While file N's ASR runs on the
GPU, file N+1 can do post-processing, utseg, or morphosyntax on CPU. The GPU
itself serializes inference, but pipeline stages overlap. On a machine with
256 GB RAM, the coordinator may grant 4–8 parallel files for transcribe.

## Worker profiles and host bootstrap mode

The server groups related commands into three worker profiles that share loaded
models within a single process:

| Profile | Commands | What it shares |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **GPU** | `align`, `transcribe`, `transcribe_s`, `benchmark` | Whisper, Wave2Vec, and speaker models in one process |
| **Stanza** | `morphotag`, `utseg`, `coref`, `compare` | Stanza NLP models (POS, constituency, coreference) |

On large machines, this means running `align` followed by `transcribe` reuses
the same GPU worker process — the ASR model loaded for transcription stays in
memory and the FA model for alignment lives in the same process. On a 64 GB
machine, this saves roughly 3 GB compared to loading each model in a separate
process.

On **small-memory hosts**, the server now resolves a different host execution
policy: local workers use **task bootstrap** instead of full profile bootstrap.
That lets a weak laptop load only `infer:asr` or `infer:morphosyntax` instead
of speculatively loading every model in a profile. The machine trades some
reuse for a much lower idle footprint.

GPU workers handle multiple requests concurrently via internal threading only on
CUDA-capable hosts. On CPU-only hosts they stay sequential to avoid
oversubscribing OpenMP threads. Stanza and IO workers handle one request at a
time but can run multiple processes in parallel for CPU-bound workloads.

## Per-command memory profiles

Each command loads different ML models with different memory footprints. These
values come from `runtime_constants.toml` (generated from `crates/batchalign-types/src/command_spec.rs`
via `xtask gen-runtime-toml`; shared between Rust and Python at compile/import time):

| Command | Memory per worker (MB) | What drives it |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| `morphotag` | 2,000 | Stanza POS/lemma/depparse models (per language) |
| `align` | 4,000 | Whisper or Wave2Vec forced alignment model |
| `transcribe` | 1,500 | Whisper ASR model |
| `utseg` | 2,000 | Stanza constituency parser |
| `translate` | 4,000 | Translation model (Seamless M4T or Google) |
| `coref` | 2,000 | Stanza coreference model |
| `compare` | 2,000 | Stanza models (for normalization) |

These are the *thread worker* values (shared-model mode). Process worker values
are higher because each worker loads its own copy of the models.

Commands in the same profile share a worker process, so the total memory for
a mixed job (e.g., `align` + `transcribe`) is roughly the sum of their models
loaded once, not separately. The GPU profile typically uses ~5 GB total for all
its models (ASR + FA + Speaker), regardless of how many commands run.

## Warmup configuration

### The `--warmup` flag

Control which models are pre-loaded at server startup:

```bash
# Presets
batchalign3 serve start --warmup off           # No warmup — workers spawn on first job
batchalign3 serve start --warmup minimal        # Morphotag only
batchalign3 serve start --warmup full           # Morphotag + align + transcribe (default)

# Explicit command list
batchalign3 serve start --warmup align          # Only forced alignment
batchalign3 serve start --warmup morphotag,align  # Both morphotag and align
```

`warmup_commands` still describes which commands are *eligible* for warmup.
However, the current production startup path stays lazy by default: real worker
warmup is normally skipped unless you are using a test-echo or test harness
path. That matches the current resource-first architecture — small and medium
machines should not speculatively preload models at process start.

### server.yaml warmup key

```yaml
# List of commands to pre-warm at startup.
# Default: [morphotag, align, transcribe] (the "full" preset)
# Empty list = no warmup.
warmup_commands:
  - morphotag
  - align
```

The `--warmup` CLI flag overrides this config key.

### Background warmup

When warmup is actually enabled, it runs in the background — the HTTP port binds
immediately. While models are loading:

- The `/health` endpoint reports `"warmup_status": "in_progress"`
- Jobs that need a model still loading will wait for the warmup to finish
  (no duplicate worker spawns — the job reuses the in-progress warmup)
- Once complete, `/health` reports `"warmup_status": "complete"`

Warmup still fans out across commands, but each heavy worker startup must now
acquire a host-wide startup lease. Host policy may also suppress warmup
entirely, and constrained hosts keep warmup off so background preload cannot
stampede the machine.

### On-demand loading

With `--warmup off`, no workers are pre-loaded. Workers spawn lazily on the
first job that needs them. This is ideal for:

- Testing and development
- Users who only run one command type
- Memory-constrained machines where you don't want idle model overhead

Lazy startup does **not** mean the first real command is allowed to run against
unknown infer-task metadata. The current server resolves that by forcing a live
capability probe from the worker it is actually about to use. In practice:

- `/health` may still show an optimistic command surface immediately after boot
- the first real job pays the worker startup cost and records the detected
  infer-task/engine-version view
- later jobs reuse that detected capability view instead of the cold-start
  placeholder

## server.yaml reference

Key tuning parameters:

```yaml
# Worker parallelism
max_workers_per_job: 0          # 0 = auto-plan from files, CPU, and category caps
max_concurrent_jobs: 0          # 0 = CPU-based runner slot cap
gpu_thread_pool_size: 4         # Concurrent execute_v2 per shared GPU worker.
                                 # Rust dispatch_semaphore + Python ThreadPoolExecutor
                                 # share this ceiling — set to the device's real
                                 # parallelism (1 on Apple Silicon CPU-only;
                                 # 2-4 on CUDA where the GIL is released).
max_concurrent_worker_startups: 1

# Memory tier override — force a specific tier instead of auto-detecting
# from total RAM. Values: small, medium, large, fleet. Omit to auto-detect.
# memory_tier: small

# Host-memory reserve/headroom (MB) preserved after reservations
# 0 = disable explicit reserve. Default: 2048 MB (one absolute floor on
# every host; the worker-pool admission gate enforces the same number
# live on every spawn attempt — see book/src/batchalign/developer/memory-safety.md)
memory_gate_mb: 4000

# Per-profile startup reservation overrides (MB). 0 = use tier default.
# These control how much memory the coordinator reserves while a worker
# loads its models. Reduce on small machines if the tier defaults are
# too conservative for your actual model sizes.
# gpu_startup_mb: 6000
# stanza_startup_mb: 3000
# io_startup_mb: 2000

# Worker lifecycle
# Idle workers are evicted by host memory pressure (largest-RSS first
# when available memory drops below the eviction threshold) — there is
# no fixed idle timeout. Health checks run every `worker_health_interval_s`.
worker_health_interval_s: 30    # Health check frequency

# Warmup — list of commands to pre-load at startup
# Default: [morphotag, align, transcribe]
# Empty list disables warmup entirely.
warmup_commands:
  - morphotag
  - align
  - transcribe
```

## Scenarios

### 16 GB laptop / shared developer machine

```yaml
# The Small tier (<24 GB) auto-detects these defaults, so this config
# is only needed if you want to further customize on a small machine.
memory_tier: small              # Force small tier (auto-detected on <24 GB)
max_workers_per_job: 1
memory_gate_mb: 2000            # Small tier default
stanza_startup_mb: 3000         # Actual Stanza RSS is ~2-3 GB
gpu_startup_mb: 6000            # Whisper float32 is ~4-5 GB
max_concurrent_worker_startups: 1
gpu_thread_pool_size: 1
warmup_commands: []             # No warmup — workers spawn on demand
```

The Small tier now also switches local workers to **task bootstrap** and clamps
eligible file-parallel commands to one file at a time. That keeps the execution
shape honest for 16 GB laptops: no speculative profile preload, no multi-file
GPU stampede, and no assumption that the machine can afford idle models it is
not about to use.

Or start with no warmup:

```bash
batchalign3 serve start --warmup off
```

### 32 GB desktop

Default settings usually work well, but keep warmup conservative if the machine
also runs other inference tools. The coordinator will clamp jobs as host
pressure changes.

### 256 GB server (production)

```yaml
max_workers_per_job: 0          # Coordinator-backed auto planning
max_concurrent_jobs: 8
max_concurrent_worker_startups: 1
memory_gate_mb: 8000            # Operator override; the default is 2048 MB (MIN_FREE_MEMORY_MB)
warmup_commands:
  - morphotag
  - align
  - transcribe
```

With this much RAM, worker profiles let the server run multiple concurrent jobs
efficiently. A GPU worker handling an `align` job and a Stanza worker handling a
`morphotag` job run in parallel without duplicating models, leaving plenty of
headroom for additional jobs.

### Testing with --warmup off

For quick iteration during development:

```bash
batchalign3 serve start --warmup off --foreground --test-echo
```

Workers start instantly (no ML models loaded). Useful for testing server
infrastructure without waiting for model initialization.

## Troubleshooting

### "Job deferred due to memory pressure"

The host-memory coordinator could not fit the requested execution plan. Possible causes:

1. **Too many concurrent workers.** Reduce `max_workers_per_job` or
   `gpu_thread_pool_size`.
2. **Other processes using RAM.** Check system memory usage.
3. **Idle workers holding memory.** Workers that haven't been used in a while
    still hold their loaded models. The pool's pressure-driven eviction
    releases idle workers automatically when host available memory drops
    below the eviction threshold; if pressure is genuine but eviction
    isn't firing fast enough, restart the server to reclaim immediately.
4. **Another local batchalign3 server or test run is already holding leases.**
   Check `/health` for `host_memory_*` fields.

Jobs are re-queued when the plan does not fit. `/health` now reports
`host_memory_pressure`, current reservations, and active lease labels.

### Only 1 worker running

The coordinator decided that only 1 worker currently fits. Check:

- `/health` `host_memory_pressure` and `host_memory_reserved_mb`
- `memory_gate_mb`
- `gpu_thread_pool_size` for GPU commands
- other local `batchalign3` servers or ML tools on the same host

Override with `max_workers_per_job` if you know your system can handle more.

### Startup takes too long

Warmup loads ML models from disk (or downloads them on first run). To speed up:

- Use `--warmup minimal` or `--warmup off` if you don't need all commands
- The first run after installation is slowest (model downloads)
- Subsequent starts load from the model cache (~5-20 seconds per model)
- Keep the daemon running (`batchalign3 serve start`) to avoid repeated
  cold starts
