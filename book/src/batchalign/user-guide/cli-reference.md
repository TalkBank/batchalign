# CLI Reference

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-11 09:55 EDT

This page documents the current public `batchalign3` CLI surface. For anything
you are scripting against, confirm with `batchalign3 <command> --help`.

For detailed input/output patterns and mutation behavior per command, see
[Command I/O Parity](../reference/command-io.md).

## Command shape

```bash
batchalign3 [GLOBAL OPTIONS] COMMAND [COMMAND OPTIONS] [PATHS...]
```

Global options go before the command name.

## Global options

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv` | Increase verbosity |
| `--parallel N` | Maximum number of input files processed concurrently (default: 8; minimum: 1). |
| `--force-cpu` | Disable MPS/CUDA and force CPU-only models |
| `--server URL` | Remote server URL. Env fallback: `BATCHALIGN_SERVER` |
| `--override-media-cache` | Bypass the media analysis cache (audio tasks only; text NLP tasks are not cached at all) |
| `--override-media-cache-tasks TASKS` | Bypass cache only for specific audio tasks (comma-separated: `forced_alignment`, `utr_asr`) |
| `--batch-window N` | Files per batch window for text NLP commands (default: 25) |
| `--debug-dir PATH` | Directory for pipeline debug artifacts (CHAT/JSON fixtures for offline replay). Env fallback: `BATCHALIGN_DEBUG_DIR` |
| `--memory-tier {small,medium,large,fleet}` | Override the auto-detected memory tier (forces worker bootstrap and memory budgets for that tier regardless of actual system RAM) |
| `--timeout SECONDS` | Inference timeout for audio tasks (default: 1800 = 30 min) |
| `--tui` / `--no-tui` | Toggle full-screen TUI for server-backed jobs (`DirectHost` local runs stay on terminal progress bars) |
| `--open-dashboard` / `--no-open-dashboard` | Toggle browser auto-open for submitted server job pages (macOS only, interactive TTY only) |
| `--engine-overrides JSON` | Select built-in alternative engines with a flat `{string:string}` JSON object; invalid JSON is rejected |
| `--sequential` | Process files one at a time with a single worker. No memory gate, no server. Ideal for small jobs on laptops |
| `--no-server` | Skip auto-detection of a local server; force direct in-process execution |

BA2 compatibility flags (`--memlog`, `--mem-guard`, `--adaptive-workers`,
`--pool`, `--shared-models`, etc.) have been removed. If your scripts use them,
remove them.

## Sequential mode

`--sequential` gives you the simplest possible execution path — similar to
batchalign2's direct mode. One worker per task type, files processed one at a
time, no concurrency infrastructure:

```bash
batchalign3 morphotag corpus/ -o output/ --sequential
```

**What it does:**
- Forces `--parallel 1` and `--no-server`
- Disables the memory gate (no cross-process coordination)
- Keeps the worker alive for the entire run (no idle timeout kills)
- Preserves the utterance cache (repeated runs benefit from cached results)

**When to use it:**
- Processing a handful of files on a laptop
- Debugging pipeline issues (predictable, single-threaded execution)
- Environments where memory auto-tuning is unwanted

**When NOT to use it:**
- Large corpus runs (50+ files) — the default parallel mode is 3-5× faster
- Fleet machines with warm workers — use the server instead

`--sequential` is incompatible with `--server` (mutually exclusive).

## Dashboard browser auto-open

On macOS, when you run a processing command interactively (e.g.,
`batchalign3 transcribe corpus/ output/`), the CLI automatically opens the
job's dashboard page in your default browser. This lets you monitor progress
in real time.

Direct local execution does not submit an HTTP job, so there is no dashboard
page to open. In that mode, `--open-dashboard` is a no-op and the CLI shows
local terminal progress inline instead.

The dashboard auto-open is **only** triggered when:

- Running on macOS (no-op on Linux/Windows)
- stderr is connected to an interactive terminal (TTY)
- `--no-open-dashboard` was not passed
- The `BATCHALIGN_NO_BROWSER` environment variable is not set

It will **not** fire in non-interactive contexts: cron jobs, CI pipelines,
SSH sessions without a display, piped output, or scripts. To suppress it
explicitly in interactive sessions, pass `--no-open-dashboard`.

## Common path-processing options

The file-processing commands accept one or more input files or directories:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PATHS...` | Input files or directories, walked recursively |
| `-o`, `--out DIR` | Output directory; otherwise write beside each source |
| `-i`, `--input-list FILE`, `--file-list FILE` | Read additional input paths from a text file |

### Input lists

An input list is UTF-8 text with one file or directory path per line. Blank
lines and lines beginning with `#` are ignored. Relative paths are resolved
against the list file's directory; absolute paths are accepted. Paths with
spaces need no quotes. Missing paths are errors.

```text
# Individual file and a directory to scan recursively
recordings/interview.wav
/data/corpus/session2
```

```bash
batchalign3 transcribe --lang eng -i recordings.txt
batchalign3 align -i transcripts.txt -o aligned
batchalign3 morphotag first.cha second.cha corpus/
```

The positional input is optional when `-i` is supplied. Positional paths and
list entries can also be combined. Both use the same discovery rules, and
repeated or overlapping files are processed once. For `ai`, the instruction
remains required: `batchalign3 ai "Fix punctuation" -i transcripts.txt`.

Without `-o`, outputs use each source's normal location. With `-o`, directory
structure is preserved relative to the common ancestor of the input
directories (or parent directories for individual files). A single directory
keeps its existing output layout. Comparison still finds gold templates beside
each selected transcript.

For batched text-NLP commands (`morphotag`, `utseg`, `translate`, `coref`),
large `--file-list` runs may not show file-by-file on-disk rewrites while the
invocation is still running. The command can batch/stage work internally and
then commit the in-place writes when the current invocation finishes. If you
need visible write-through during a long rerun, split the list into smaller
chunks and run those chunks sequentially.

## Processing commands

Each processing command has a dedicated page with full options, a pipeline
diagram, examples, and gotchas. Click the command name for complete
documentation.

### CHAT-mutation commands (input `.cha` → output `.cha`)

| Command | What it does |

| [**benchmark**](commands/benchmark.md) | Transcribe and evaluate WER against gold `.cha` references |

## Operational commands

### `setup`

Initialize `~/.batchalign.ini`:

```bash
batchalign3 setup
batchalign3 setup --non-interactive --engine whisper
batchalign3 setup --non-interactive --engine rev --rev-key <KEY>
```

Options:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--engine {rev,whisper}` | Persist default ASR engine |
| `--rev-key KEY` | Rev.AI key for non-interactive setup |
| `--non-interactive` | Disable prompts |

### `logs`

```bash
batchalign3 logs
batchalign3 logs --last
batchalign3 logs --export
batchalign3 logs --clear
```

Key options:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--last` | Show the most recent run log |
| `--raw` | Raw JSONL output with `--last` |
| `--export` | Zip recent logs |
| `--clear` | Delete log files |
| `--follow` | Tail the newest log file |
| `-n`, `--count N` | Number of recent runs to list |

### `serve`

```bash
batchalign3 serve start --foreground
batchalign3 serve status
batchalign3 serve stop
```

`serve start` key options:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--port PORT` | Listen port |
| `--host HOST` | Bind address |
| `--config PATH` | Alternate `server.yaml` path |
| `--python PATH` | Worker Python executable |
| `--foreground` | Do not daemonize |
| `--test-echo` | Start test-echo workers |
| `--warmup VALUE` | Warmup preset (`off`, `minimal`, `full`) or comma-separated command list (e.g. `align,morphotag`) |

### `jobs`

```bash
batchalign3 jobs --server http://myserver:8000
batchalign3 jobs --server http://myserver:8000 <JOB_ID>
batchalign3 jobs <JOB_ID>
batchalign3 jobs --json <JOB_ID>
batchalign3 jobs cancellations <JOB_ID>
```

With `--server`, lists or inspects remote jobs. Without `--server`,
inspects the local job artifact directory for post-failure debugging.
Pass `--json` for machine-readable output.

The `cancellations` subcommand prints the cancellation audit history
for a single job — every cancel attempt is recorded with `source`
(tui / api / dashboard / staging / signal), `host`, `pid`, `reason`,
and `in_flight_filename`. Use this when a user reports "I didn't
cancel that job."

### `cache`

```bash
batchalign3 cache stats
batchalign3 cache clear --yes
batchalign3 cache clear --all --yes
```

`BATCHALIGN_ANALYSIS_CACHE_DIR` and `BATCHALIGN_MEDIA_CACHE_DIR` relocate
the underlying caches for isolated runs. BA2-compatible flag forms
`cache --stats` and `cache --clear` are still accepted.

### `openapi`

```bash
batchalign3 openapi -o openapi.json
batchalign3 openapi --check --output openapi.json
```

`--check` exits non-zero when the target file does not match the generated
schema.

### `models`

Two subcommands:

| Subcommand | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `models prep` | Extract training text from CHAT files (Rust-native, no CLAN needed) |
| `models train` | Forward to the Python training runtime (`python -m batchalign.models.training.run`) |

See [Models Training Runtime ADR](../decisions/models-training-runtime-adr.md).

### `ipc-schema`

```bash
batchalign3 ipc-schema -o schemas/
batchalign3 ipc-schema --check --output schemas/
```

Emits JSON Schema for Rust→Python IPC types. Without `-o`, schemas are
written to stdout as a single JSON object. With `--check`, exits non-zero
on schema drift against the target directory.

### `bench`

```bash
batchalign3 bench <COMMAND> <IN_DIR> <OUT_DIR> [--runs N]
```

Benchmark command execution time across repeated runs. `<COMMAND>` is
one of: `align`, `transcribe`, `transcribe_s` (with diarization),
`compare`. Distinct from the `benchmark` top-level command, which
measures ASR word accuracy.

### `doctor`

```bash
batchalign3 doctor
batchalign3 doctor --lang yue --format json
```

Pre-flight diagnostic that spawns a test worker, sends known inputs
through the morphosyntax pipeline, and validates the output structure.
Catches machine-specific issues (stale models, missing processors, MWT
quirks) before they become production failures.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--lang LANG` | Language to test (default: `eng`) |
| `--format {human,json}` | Output format (default: `human`) |
| `--python PATH` | Custom Python path (overrides `BATCHALIGN_PYTHON`) |

### `replay`

```bash
batchalign3 replay <DUMP_FILE>
batchalign3 replay --lang yue path/to/failed_ipc_*.json
```

Replay a captured failed IPC request against a fresh worker. Takes a
dump file from `~/.batchalign3/debug/` and sends the exact request to
a new worker, reporting the response. Useful for reproducing field
failures locally.

### `eval`

```bash
batchalign3 eval l2-morphotag <ARGS>
```

Evaluation subcommands. Currently:

| Subcommand | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `eval l2-morphotag` | L2 morphotag evaluation: pair `@s` words with `%mor` / `%gra` items via typed AST walk (supersedes `scripts/l2-eval/analyze.py`) |

### `version`

```bash
batchalign3 version
```

Prints version and build information.

## Exit codes

`batchalign3` uses stable non-zero exit code categories:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `2` | Usage/input error |
| `3` | Configuration error |
| `4` | Network/connectivity error |
| `5` | Server/job lifecycle error |
| `6` | Local runtime error |

Exit code `1` is reserved for unexpected failures outside the typed categories.
