"""Helper to load *every* pypi dep from the lockfile.

rules_python's `all_requirements` symbol from `@pypi//:requirements.bzl`
lists every package name in `requirements.lock.txt` regardless of
whether the package's marker matches the resolved platform/Python.
pip.parse correctly skips writing BUILD files for marker-excluded
packages, leaving dangling names in `all_requirements` that break
`deps = all_requirements` at analysis time.

This module wraps `all_requirements` and filters out names that are
known to be marker-conditional in this project's lockfile. It is NOT
a hand-maintained list of *which* deps to include — that list lives
entirely in `pyproject.toml`. This is a list of *which marker-
conditional names rules_python skips*, derived from grepping
requirements.lock.txt for `; python_full_version` / `; sys_platform`
markers that don't satisfy our pinned 3.12 + cross-platform set.
Korean G2P's two platform-specific analyzer roots also need an explicit
select because the hub omits them from all_requirements on matching hosts.

Track upstream: bazel-contrib/rules_python#2244 (and friends) — once
fixed, this whole file collapses to `_RUNTIME_DEPS = all_requirements`
directly in the consumer BUILD.
