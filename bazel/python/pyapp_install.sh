# Build pyapp from local source via Bazel-provided cargo.
#
# Run as the cmd of //python/batchalign:sidecar (a genrule with
# `local = True`). Bazel hands us the Bazel-tracked wheel + the
# Bazel-fetched pyapp source as $(execpath …) args, plus PATH-injects
# rules_rust's cargo via PYAPP_RUST_BIN_DIRS. We invoke `cargo install
# --path <pyapp_src>` so cargo:
#   - never contacts crates.io (source is local)
#   - never uses host cargo (Bazel-provided cargo on PATH)
#   - creates its own writable tmpdir copy of the source (which pyapp's
#     build.rs needs — it writes to $CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/src/embed/)
#
# `local = True` is required so cargo has a persistent place for its
# build cache; pure sandboxed actions would discard cargo's tmpdir
# between runs and pyapp's deps would re-compile every time.
#
# Args:
#   $1 = output binary path (the genrule's $@)
#   $2 = wheel path        (//python/batchalign:batchalign.whl — one of
#                           the //python/batchalign:wheel genrule's outputs)
#   $3 = pyapp Cargo.toml  (@pyapp_src//:Cargo.toml — we take dirname
#                           for `cargo install --path`)
#   $4 = compilation mode  (opt|dbg|fastbuild)
